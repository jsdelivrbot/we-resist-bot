# This Account Has Been Compromised

The account owner {{owner}} unknowingly or mistakenly sent a private key inside a memo. That is a very bad thing to do if you want to keep your account safe. Never do that. In order to protect this account, @the-resistance has replaced the keys and locked out 
hijackers from being able to steal funds from this account with the hope that the account
owner will contact us in [discord](https://discord.gg/qMWCbWR)

Again, no funds have been taken. This is just a notice that pre-emptive measures have been taken to protect the
interests of {{owner}}. Thank you.
